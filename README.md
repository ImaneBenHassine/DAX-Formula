Here is some of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formulas I wrote within Power BI to solve simple up to very advanced analytical problems.

Data Source : the US Superstore dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/juhi1994/superstore

- build a dimensional data model from transactional data.
### DAX formulas :
- Variables in calculated tables using tableGrouped
- Variables in text
- Variables in calculated column
- Variables in calculated measure
- Context in DAX
- Filter Context: Implicit / Explicit
- Row Context
- Query Context
- SUMMARIZE
- SUMMARIZATIONCOLUMNS
- SUMMARIZE WITH A FILTER
- GROUP BY
